# IELST™: Advanced AI-Interpreting & Cognitive Learning Ecosystem

> **"Speak correctly!"**
> IELST™ is a high-performance language acquisition platform that merges **State-of-the-Art (SOTA) AI models** with **Cognitive Science** principles. It is designed to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and real-time linguistic performance.

🔗 **System Access:** [IELST™ Portal](https://www.ankommen-in-niedersachsen.com/IELST)  
*(Note: **Private Access Only.** This system is not available to the public. Account activation is strictly limited to the developer for personal research purposes.)*

## 🧠 Scientific Foundation: The Ebbinghaus Engine
The core of the vocabulary system is built upon the **Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve**. By utilizing a sophisticated **Spaced Repetition System (SRS)**, the software calculates the optimal time for review to facilitate the transition of lexical items from short-term to long-term memory.

### 🗂️ Vocabulary Mastery & SRS
* **9 Neural Reinforcement Stages:** Reviews are scheduled at specific intervals (1d, 2d, 4d, 7d, 15d, 30d, 60d, 90d, 180d).
* **AI Contextual Encoding:** Uses 120B parameter models to generate natural examples, enhancing semantic memory.
* **Native Audio Integration:** Instant phonetic feedback for auditory reinforcement.

## 🎙️ AI Real-Time Interpreting Simulator
This module simulates high-stakes cognitive tasks by requiring users to interpret complex scenarios in real-time. It leverages advanced speech processing to provide immediate academic evaluation.

* **Acoustic Processing:** Integration with **Whisper V3** for low-latency, high-fidelity speech-to-text transcription.
* **Multi-Dimensional Evaluation:** Speech is analyzed across **Coherence, Lexical Resource, Grammatical Accuracy, and Fluency**.
* **WPM Metrics:** Monitors retrieval speed and cognitive load through real-time "Words Per Minute" tracking.

## 📊 Data-Driven Analytics
IELST™ transforms every practice session into actionable data. The system monitors progress through advanced statistical visualizations, providing a clear roadmap to the target Band Score.

### 📉 Progress Tracking
The platform calculates predicted band scores for each skill (Reading, Writing, Listening, Speaking) based on a weighted matrix of practice volume and mastery levels.

### 🧪 The Learning Funnel
The **Neural Lexical Funnel** visualizes the flow of vocabulary through the SRS pipeline, distinguishing between "Encountered", "Reviewing", and "Mastered" states.

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture
The system is built for high concurrency and low latency, ensuring that AI evaluations and speech processing happen in near real-time.

* **AI Stack:** Groq Cloud API, Whisper-Large-V3, Llama 3.3 (70B), and GPT-OSS (120B).
* **Backend:** Optimized PHP Core with a robust MySQL relational database.
* **Frontend:** JavaScript (ES6+), ApexCharts.js for data visualization, and Bootstrap 5.
* **Format:** Progressive Web App (PWA) – Installable on any device.

### 💾 Relational Database Design
The architecture ensures data integrity and high-speed retrieval for cumulative practice logging and SRS scheduling.
